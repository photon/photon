/**
 * Bootstrap file for PHPUnit.
 *
 * To correctly run the unit tests with PHPUnit one needs to have:
 *
 * - the Photon autoloader in the autoloader SPL stack.
 * - the unit test configuration loaded.
 *
 * But... PHPUnit accepts only one PHP prepend file. Good news,
 * PHPUnit can also set some php.ini values before the run. So, Photon
 * is calling PHPUnit with this bootstrap file and at the same time,
 * it passes PHPUnit the photon.config value with the path to the
 * config file for the unit tests.
 *
 * Of course, if you do not like this bootstrap file, you can run your
 * tests this way:
 * 
 * $ photon runtests --bootstrap=path/to/yourbootstrap.php
 *
 * Also, by default, Photon will load the config.test.php file in your
 * current folder. You can change it by running:
 *
 * $ photon --conf=path/to/myconfig.php runtests
 *
 * You can combine them:
 *
 * $ photon --conf=fooconfig.php runtests --bootstrap=/other/testbootstrap.php
 * 
 * WARNING: For added security, photon will never accept to run tests
 * against a config file named "config.php". This is to avoid the
 * "oops I run the tests against my production settings and I have
 * just dropped the main database.".
